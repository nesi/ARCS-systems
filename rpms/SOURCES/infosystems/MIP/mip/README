The Modular Information Provider (MIP) collects information using MIP modules 
that can easily be created and grouped using MIP packages. MIP is designed to 
automatically integrate, relate, and bind information from multiple MIP 
instances using MIP Integrator. MIP provides straight-forward customization to 
a specific grid or site.
