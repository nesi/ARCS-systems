This howto is for running the MIP with an example configuration to illustrate it working.


First unpack the mip source

	tar zxf mip-0.2.7.tar.gz
	cd mip-0.2.7


grab a copy of the installer patch

	svn cat http://auriga.qut.edu.au/svn/apac/gateway/MIP/patches/0.2.7/installer.patch > installer.patch


patch the installer

	patch -p0 < installer.patch


install

	./install_mip


grab the package (must be saved as apac_py)

	svn co http://auriga.qut.edu.au/svn/apac/gateway/MIP/modules/apac_py/trunk/ modules/apac_py


grab the example configuration (must be named apac_config.py)

	cp modules/apac_py/example_config.py config/apac_config.py


make sure the configuration correctly points to your qstat and pbsnodes executables, and you've changed queue_name to the name of your queue in the Name of the ComputingElement

	edit config/apac_config.py looking for qstat and pbsnodes, and queue_name


create config/apac_py.pl

	it is important the the uids here (things in "") match the keys in config/apac_config.py.  If you copy below verbatim you should be OK

		clusterlist => ['apac_py'],

		uids =>  {      
			Site => [ "TEST", ],
			SubCluster => [ "sub1", ],
			Cluster => [ "cluster1", ],
			ComputingElement => [ "compute1", ],
			StorageElement => [ "storage1", ],
		}
