				This document is generated by ARCS SharedToken

				certificate. The ownership of the document is guaranteed by the
				request of Shibboleth authentication to the service. The document is
				used when a user is transfered
				from one institution to another
				institution within the federation.
				The user will be asked to present
				the document to the new
				institution admin when he/she is registered
				to the institution. The
				admin will verify the signature with the PDF
				Reader and then
				populate the SharedToken to the repository.</param>
