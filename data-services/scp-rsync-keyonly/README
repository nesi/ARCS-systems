# to make scp-ft.pl work for a specific unattended data transfer solution

#1 customize allowed paths in scp-ft.pl

#2 put the script somewhere convenient and make it executable

#3 generate a key-pair (openssh 2 example) with empty passphrase
# alternatively, get the remote user to create a keypair and supply 
  you with the public key

ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f scp-ft-key

#4 add the public key to .ssh/authorized keys in the user@host account hosting the service

cat scp-ft-key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

#5 edit authorized_keys to include a command and possibly other restrictions
# line becomes:
command="/path/to/scp-ft.pl -v" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...

other restrictions might include:
 no-port-forwarding
 no-X11-forwarding
 no-agent-forwarding
 no-pty

#6 include -v if you want the user to get feedback - otherwise it will be very secretive

#7 provide the private key (scp-ft-key) to the down/up loader and tell them to upload download with
# (where user and host are the place where the authorized_keys file is...)

scp -i scp-ft-key localfile user@host:destination/
scp -i scp-ft-key -rp localdir user@host:destination/
scp -i scp-ft-key -rp localdir/. user@host:destination/

# or

scp -i scp-ft-key user@host:sourcedir/file localdest
scp -i scp-ft-key -rp user@host:sourcedir localdest/
scp -i scp-ft-key -rp user@host:sourcedir/ localdest/
