Bulk Data Transfer Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ref: http://fasterdata.es.net/

These scripts were developed for high-speed transfer of telescope and
pulsar data from remote and other-capital sites to Perth.

Note that fdtPut7.sh was upgraded 20090804 so as to transfer batches of files
instead of individual files; when tested with "-b 32" this gave a 15 times
performance increase in local VPAC tests.  It's performance is still only
about 30% of that delivered by "gloPut7.sh -u".

Also note that gloPut8.sh was instantiated 20090902 on recommendation of
developers .. uses '-rst' for stall detection.  Doesn't work in practise!

On 20090908, gloPut7.sh was enhanced so as to detect SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
for on-the-fly switching between TCP and UDT modes.

On 20090929, gloPut7.sh was further enhanced by replacing the progressive
kill function with 'kill -9', and adding a kill-zombie-parents capability.
In a future release, the zombie-parent-killer will run continuously in
background.
