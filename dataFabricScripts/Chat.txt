(9:19:17 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Good Morning! Kai
(9:19:37 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: HI Sridhar!
(9:19:59 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Hey are you at the moment to have small chat about SRB?
(9:20:06 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: free
(9:20:18 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: yes.
(9:20:23 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thnaks..
(9:21:09 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have installed SRB server on CentOS5.2 virtual machine I need to start playing with it, Can you suggest me how to start?
(9:21:58 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Have u federated to other sites?
(9:22:05 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: No..
(9:22:09 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Ok.
(9:22:39 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Just want to learn SRB by using simple server-client model 
(9:22:42 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: You can browse SRB official web site first.
(9:23:12 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Have you setup a srb client?
(9:23:48 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: If yes, can you connect to your srb server?
(9:23:50 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Been through arcs data serveice webpages, I guess scommands client will install automatically with SRB rpms isnt'it?
(9:24:22 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: yes for Scommands.
(9:24:46 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: One thing How to login as srb user? what is the password for it?
(9:25:31 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Do u want to login as srb admin? normal users?
(9:26:15 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: to add more resources and to federate we need to login as srb isnt'it? 
(9:26:30 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ofcourse srbadmin
(9:26:32 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: the user is srbAdmin
(9:28:09 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: if you have installed SRB from our packages, you run Sinit and login as srb admin. Then, you can what you would like to do.
(9:28:38 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: what is the passsword for srbAdmin?
(9:29:04 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes I have installed from arcs rpm repository
(9:29:41 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: If you run Sinit in the server side, it can login as srb admin automatically. 
(9:30:05 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohhh thats cool
(9:30:57 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: If you want to know where the its password is, you can enter directory of user srb, run cd .srb
(9:31:08 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: there is file callled as .MdasAuth.
(9:31:51 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: it is hidden file, is diplayed by running ls -al
(9:32:05 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes I need to edit .MdasAuth before starting anything
(9:32:11 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: No.
(9:32:12 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I havent done yet
(9:32:42 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: You do not touch it at the moment.
(9:32:49 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ok..
(9:33:26 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: but if run Sinit as root I am gettting error "Error opening client environment file:-1200"
(9:33:47 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: run as srb user, not root!
(9:34:09 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: alright
(9:35:23 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Do I need to edit gridftp_srb.conf and grid-mapfile.srb files before doing anything?
(9:36:25 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Not necessary, but you wan to play gridftp-dsi-srb or using srb gsi authorization.
(9:36:34 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: It is ok for using Scommands.
(9:38:29 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: If I run Sinit form user od srb group I am getting error" firstInitSrbClientEnv: Unable to open mdasEnvFile:/root/.srb/.MdasEnv"
(9:38:56 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: r u familiar with linux commands?
(9:39:06 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes..
(9:39:23 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Not expert though..
(9:39:33 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Can you paste how you run?
(9:41:05 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Just loged in as user account (who is member of srb group) and run $Sinit
(9:41:31 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Can you copy and paste them?
(9:42:09 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: wiat please
(9:43:02 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: [sridhar@vmcentsrb ~]$ /usr/bin/Sinit
firstInitSrbClientEnv: Unable to open mdasEnvFile:/home/sridhar/.srb/.MdasEnv
Error Opening Client Environment File:-1200
[sridhar@vmcentsrb ~]$
(9:43:49 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: You login as yourself, not user srb.
(9:44:00 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: You should login as user srb
(9:44:34 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: But we need password to login as srb thats what I dont know
(9:44:58 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: so I made my useraccount as member of "srb" usergroup
(9:45:03 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Or, i assume that you wan t to use server-client model. Then, you should create a .MdasEnv and .MdasAuth files in the your home directory.
(9:46:06 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: You must make sure you have srb admin rights to do srb federation, i think.
(9:46:37 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: One thing do we have password to login as srb user? If so what is it?
(9:46:43 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Actually,, youzhen knows much more about your current system environments.
(9:47:26 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually Youzhen is in holydays for one week. So I am working my self by making SRB virtual machine
(9:48:16 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Did you create the VM yourself/
(9:48:26 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes..
(9:48:33 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Oh.good.
(9:48:50 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am using Vmware server
(9:48:51 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Can you login as user srb?
(9:49:07 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: what is password for srb?
(9:49:22 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: The RPM should create a system user:srb
(9:49:55 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: after you have installed, it does not have password.
(9:50:17 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes It is created user account 
(9:50:18 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: [root@vmcentsrb sridhar]# cat /etc/passwd | grep srb

(9:55:03 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes..
(9:55:30 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Note that srbAdmin is the name of srb admin user.
(9:55:50 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: If possible can you please send me samples of gridftp_srb.conf and grid-mapfile.srb files ?
(9:56:04 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: the name of SRB system user is srb.
(9:56:12 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: They are different.
(9:56:52 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have doubt on those files I might did some mistakes in those files If you can send samples of those file that will be great..
(9:57:53 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually I have hostcertificate for my testing machine and I can use GSI authentication as well
(9:58:06 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: Ok.
(9:59:40 AM) kai.lu@arcs.org.au: The grid-mapfile.srb is as follows:

(1:36:12 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: NW :)
(1:37:04 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Okay I have installed SRB server and certificates, I am able to run scommands with srb user. What I need to do next?
(1:37:37 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: what is your server name
(1:37:48 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: vmcentsrb.ac3.edu.au
(1:37:57 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: have you got a CNAME?
(1:38:08 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: we all have a nice name, srb.SITE_NAME
(1:38:38 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: No, as it is just testing server running on my desktop computer with vmware.
(1:39:10 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I guess ac3 already had srb.ac3.edu.au server running but I dont have access to it yet! :-(
(1:39:14 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: ah, ok. if it is a testing server, you can play with it :)
(1:39:27 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: we can set up federation 
(1:40:03 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: download this script
(1:40:04 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: http://projects.arcs.org.au/trac/systems/browser/trunk/dataFabricScripts/Sfederate.py
(1:40:13 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Is there any testes I can do whether my testing server is running properly or not?
(1:40:25 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: we just use Scommands 
(1:40:33 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: do sput sget scd
(1:40:38 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: etc.
(1:40:49 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: srm
(1:41:21 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I did Scd, Smkdir etc.. are are working without any problems
(1:41:36 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: how about sget sput srm?
(1:41:47 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I will try them soon
(1:42:07 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: if they work, then this srb is set up properly
(1:42:13 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: we can try federation later
(1:42:18 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thats good news for me..
(1:42:32 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: but in the meanwhile, you can write a xml and put it to trac
(1:42:41 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have a question where we are using those certificate thing?
(1:42:47 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: http://projects.arcs.org.au/trac/systems/browser/trunk/data-services
(1:43:04 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: for the gridftp DSI
(1:43:15 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: ah, that's something you can try as well
(1:43:27 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: can you copy files with gridftp interface?
(1:43:53 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am confusing, what is gridftp interface?
(1:44:15 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: that's a gridftp interface to access SRB
(1:44:23 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: so users can use globus-url-copy
(1:44:30 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: no need to use Scommands
(1:44:35 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I havent tried that.
(1:44:53 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: that's basically for Globus users who want to submit HPC jobs
(1:44:53 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Am i need to install any gridftp client to try that?
(1:45:02 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: yes
(1:45:07 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: you need globus-url-copy
(1:45:11 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Alright
(1:45:20 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: but if you have that in another machine, you can use the other machine
(1:45:35 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: talk to Youzhen, maybe you have VDT client insatlled somewhere
(1:45:56 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Youzhen is in holydays for one week!
(1:46:01 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: haha
(1:46:20 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: ok. after the gridftp test, could you write a xml and put it here
(1:46:22 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: http://projects.arcs.org.au/trac/systems/browser/trunk/data-services
(1:46:38 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: you can see some existing ones, like sapac.xml, ivec.xml
(1:46:53 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: you can add a new one, say ac3.xml
(1:47:27 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually I dont know xml language! can I replace names in any existing files to prepare mine?
(1:47:44 PM) shunde.zhang@arcs.org.au: yes, you can copy one of them to be a start of yours
(1:47:53 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: thats good..

(3:52:05 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hi!
(3:52:30 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Can you point me to right direction of what I can do after installting SRB server? How I can create another user account with srb access?
(3:52:48 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ah yes
(3:52:57 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I can email you my "cheat sheet"
(3:52:57 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: :P
(3:53:05 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thats Great..
(3:53:48 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: One thing you can do is to create a new unix file system resource, and add it to a logical resource
(3:54:11 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: on the ARCS data fabric, all resources are logical resources name datafabric.<domain name of your organisation>
(3:54:29 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Alright..
(3:56:00 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Is that using $Sregisterresource ?
(3:56:14 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Yeap!
(3:56:19 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but beware
(3:56:21 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ...
(3:56:29 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Sometimes, Scommands don't work for no reason at all
(3:56:39 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: so I use the mcatAdmin.jar
(3:56:57 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: which works for things that sometimes doesn't work using Scommands (and vice versa)
(3:56:58 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Hmm then what I need to do? I am having only Scommands as client tools at the moment..
(3:57:10 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: let me find out where you can download it from...
(3:57:12 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: actually
(3:57:16 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I'll just attach it to the email
(3:57:26 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thanks again..
(3:57:40 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that's ok!  Keep asking those questions :) 
(3:58:10 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Sure.. I you dont feel bored I have many questions to ask..
(3:58:22 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: no no :)
(3:58:31 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's fine!  That's what the team's for :)
(3:58:50 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I was pretty lost when I've first started (well, still am!) - so I know how you feel!!
(3:59:44 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Okay we will do one thing, lets send me email I ll start working with your mail and disturb you when I have questions...
(4:01:04 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have got hostcertificate for my testing srb machine how to determine if its working or not? 
(4:01:31 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmmm
(4:01:36 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: good question...
(4:01:52 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: If you can do an Sinit to it, then it should be ok
(4:01:54 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: oh!!!
(4:01:56 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: actually
(4:02:10 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: you should add a user, which can only be authenticated with GSI_AITH
(4:02:10 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am able to run almost all Scommands with srb user
(4:02:11 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: AUTH
(4:02:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: instead of ENCRYPT1
(4:02:27 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: what's your setup like?
(4:02:30 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's all on your desktop?
(4:02:48 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Let me expalin you, my setup first to be clear
(4:03:35 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(4:04:11 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have XP desktop and two VM centOS 5.2 running as guests. I used one vm as SRB server another as client to test things working or not
(4:05:51 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(4:05:54 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: so it's a vm...
(4:05:55 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: right
(4:06:03 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: have you got your own APACGrid certificate
(4:06:03 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ?
(4:06:09 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes using VMware server
(4:06:16 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: cool :)
(4:06:40 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: as in yourself, not the server?
(4:07:02 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes I got one and placed hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem as mentioned in installation document
(4:07:30 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: no, I meant one for yourself, it should be in your ~/.globus directory
(4:07:57 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: can you do a grid-proxy-init on your machine, and not in the VM?
(4:07:57 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Opps sorry Yes I have got user certificate as well.
(4:08:02 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok :)  brillliant
(4:08:19 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: now... in the cheat sheet, you should be able to find something with Singestuser
(4:08:55 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: What you need to do, is in the VM, create a user for yourself
(4:09:11 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but make sure the authentication method is GSI_AUTH
(4:09:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and that you put in your DN as the last argument
(4:09:42 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: How to make authentication as GSI only?
(4:09:55 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Singestuser username password ngdev2.its.utas.edu.au staff 'University of Tasmania' '0362267518' 'pmak@utas.edu.au' GSI_AUTH '/C=AU/O=APACGrid/OU=TPAC/CN=Pauline Mak'

(4:10:04 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: the second last argument specifies the authenticatio method
(4:10:27 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Cool
(4:10:39 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: If you type in the command without arguments, you should get some example usages
(4:10:43 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: now...
(4:10:53 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: let me know how you go witha dding the user
(4:11:04 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Sure let me try that..
(4:11:05 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: once we have that, we can test whether you can authenticate with the server, which can also test if your certificates are working
(4:15:02 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: you don't have to remember the password, but that field has to be specified even if we are using GSI_AUTH :P
(4:16:43 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Is Singestuser should be local user as well?
(4:16:51 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: nope
(4:16:59 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: you can make it to whatever you want
(4:17:02 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I mean am i nee dto create local user account with same username?
(4:17:08 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: no
(4:17:12 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Good
(4:17:14 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's an SRB only thing :)

(11:44:16 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: anyway...
(11:44:21 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: so you've downloaded the form?
(11:44:33 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: did you see Daniel's example?
(11:44:37 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes its sitting my desk from last week
(11:44:39 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it should be an attachment on basecamp
(11:45:07 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: http://anusf.grouphub.com/projects/1168495/file/18110879/Request_for_Travel_Expenditure_final.doc
(11:45:32 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I had that form
(11:46:00 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: eResearch is basically a conference....
(11:46:08 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: before ARCS was ARCS, it was called APAC
(11:46:16 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and each year, APAC had its own internal conference
(11:46:24 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ok..
(11:46:31 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but since APAC is no more, this meeting has been rebadged as eRearch
(11:47:20 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: as far as the data team goes, we have a talk during the conference about the data fabric and also a workshop on the Thursday
(11:47:33 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: http://www.eresearch.edu.au/
(11:47:38 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: you can see the program from the website :)
(11:47:46 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: what we ACTUALLY do
(11:47:52 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: will probably be a lot of dirnking :P
(11:48:02 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I mean... networking
(11:48:27 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ?
(11:48:40 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: networking = talking to other people and getting contacts
(11:48:53 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: When we need to be there when we will come back?
(11:49:06 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: we need to be there on the 28th September (Sunday)
(11:49:16 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: since Tony wanted to have an ARCS only meeting on that day
(11:49:19 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Alright..
(11:49:29 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it should start at 10, so book for a ticket that will mean you'll arrive before then
(11:49:41 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I believe the meeting is held at VPAC...
(11:50:03 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: do you address for meeting place?
(11:50:17 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I guess you should stay until at least the end of the workshop on the Thursday
(11:50:31 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: there's a workshop I wanted to go to on Friday, so I'll stay there until then
(11:50:34 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(11:50:35 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: not sure
(11:50:46 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: we don't even have a room number for the meeting
(11:50:54 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's all a bit vague at the moment
(11:50:55 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thats cool
(11:51:00 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: perhaps natalie can help you out?
(11:52:00 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have to go through eResearch website then..
(11:52:13 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeap
(11:52:16 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: you should register!!
(11:52:39 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Alright..
(11:53:04 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: you don't need to register for the data fabric workshop, since you'll be helping out at it
(11:54:45 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually where you are from? I mean which city?
(11:55:16 AM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I'm originally from Hong Kong, but have been in Tasmania for like 20 years
(11:55:29 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohhhhh
(11:57:03 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have a question Does all SRB servers at each location except at ac3 are in production?
(11:57:27 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I mean are any real using using this infrastructure ?
(11:57:36 AM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: users..
(12:05:56 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I think so
(12:06:00 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(12:06:05 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: not that many real users at the moment
(12:06:15 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's only started to be in production in late June/July
(12:07:42 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but we're working towards getting more :)
(12:08:02 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: so if you hear about anyone who wants to store their data, tell them about the data fabric!
(12:23:27 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: because we haven't done anything on this end!!!
(12:35:39 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Alright.. We need to marketing as well :)
(12:36:01 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeap :)
(12:36:08 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: we are the face of the data fabric :P
(12:36:16 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hopefully we'll get lots of interest from the workshop
(12:36:27 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes..
(12:37:07 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Hey what about ARCS all hands meeting on 27th sep 10 am? dont we need to attend that?

(12:38:37 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually it might be typo mistake as 27th is not sunday
(12:38:47 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah :P
(12:38:52 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: because 26th is grandfinal night
(12:39:00 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and most hotels will charge an extra $200 for the accommodation

(12:41:18 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohhh
(12:41:39 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and possibly funding from somewhere else ;)

(12:43:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: maybe... post something to your comment on basecamp?  I don't really understand...
(12:44:06 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: well...

(12:47:16 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(12:47:40 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/InstallCABundle
(12:47:42 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: At the moment my scope is very small to do anything..
(12:48:07 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: also: http://wiki.arcs.org.au/bin/view/Main/HostCertRequestAPACGridCA
(12:48:17 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: at the bottom, there's instructions on testing if your host certificate works
(12:48:18 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thanks for that link I will try that one
(12:50:42 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: How long you are working with TPAC?
(12:50:48 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: since March last year
(12:50:58 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: before that?
(12:53:23 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I was working in a software firm for a couple of years before than
(12:53:31 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and before that, as a research assistant at uni
(12:53:38 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and then, just studying before then :P
(12:54:12 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: WHich CA bundle installation you did minimal/full? As I my srb server already has /etc/grid-security folder shall I go with minimal installation?
(12:54:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah
(12:54:24 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: go with the minimal..
(12:54:35 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I would back up all of the stuff in that directory first though
(12:54:47 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I can't remember what the bundle had in it
(12:55:07 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually I have only one file(grid-mapfile.srb) in that folder
(12:55:17 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: what about yourself?  How long have you been at ac3 for>?
(12:55:32 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: This is my third week
(12:55:50 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: heheh :P
(12:55:51 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: not long then!
(12:56:34 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes.. I was Systems/Network admin for Weather Company(Weather information provider for all over aus)

(12:56:54 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that's what's in my /etc/grid-security directory
(12:57:14 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: oooh
(12:57:14 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Alright 
(12:57:29 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that must have been an interesting job
(12:57:50 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Not interesting actually still confusing..
(12:58:04 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(12:58:18 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohh you are talking about my previous job? yes it is..
(12:58:25 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah :P 
(12:58:58 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am certified in networking, but present job is more confusing
(12:59:28 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah... I'm not even certified in network, so I'm even more confused than you are!
(12:59:39 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: :)
(1:00:15 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: It would be good if some give me training for atleast one week 
(1:00:25 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(1:00:30 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: we never really had that...
(1:00:42 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's all experiment to find out what works and what doesn't
(1:00:50 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: :)
(1:01:03 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: florian is the person to talk to though - he's set up the initial RPMs and such
(1:01:26 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohhh
(1:02:11 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: :)
(1:02:31 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: So Only florian is masters in SRB
(1:02:39 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: well
(1:02:44 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Steve is also very good too
(1:02:49 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but he didn't setup our RPMs
(1:02:55 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ok..
(1:03:06 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: there might be config files/settings that is special to our install
(1:03:15 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Steve's been using SRB for quite a few years now
(1:03:29 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Kai is very good with the logging side of things
(1:03:38 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and Shunde is the inca testing person
(1:03:43 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: What is future of our jobs? Once everything setup and running then what we need to do?
(1:03:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: we twiddle our thumbs and wait for the cash to flow in :P
(1:03:59 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: no
(1:04:02 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: not realy
(1:04:19 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: we'll probably be doing a lot of QA and adding extra feature to the fabric as new users requirements come in
(1:04:30 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Okkk
(1:04:30 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and of course, advocating the data fabric to the wider community
(1:05:11 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Then kai might be the right person to discuss with my GSI auth problem..
(1:05:47 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: maybe :)
(1:06:35 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: what is your educational qualification?
(1:06:49 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I've only got Honours in computing
(1:06:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I'm like... such a dud compared to the rest of the people....
(1:07:06 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hehe
(1:07:20 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Great..
(1:10:35 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am confusing what you mean by honours?
(1:10:50 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I taught its similar to PHD
(1:10:51 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au:  Honours is an extra year after your bachelor degree
(1:10:54 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: sort of
(1:10:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but it's much shorter
(1:11:02 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohh
(1:11:02 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and you're not expected to do as much
(1:11:19 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: there's generally 3 postgrade "types": honours, masters and PhDs
(1:11:31 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Hmm
(1:12:11 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I really dont know about honours before
(1:12:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah :P
(1:12:44 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I taught bachelor,master and Phd
(1:12:46 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: at least at UTas, you must do honours before applying for PhD
(1:12:58 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohhh
(1:19:29 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: create links in /etc/grid-security for globus-host-ssl.conf, globus-user-ssl.conf, grid-security.conf (all ending in .1e12d831)
(1:19:44 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Can you explain this please..
(1:19:47 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah
(1:19:53 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I think this means symbolic links
(1:19:55 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: i.e. 
(1:19:58 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohh\
(1:20:04 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ln -s <blah> <blah>
(1:20:32 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I mean ending with .1e12d831
(1:20:35 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ?
(1:20:59 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I think you should link to the file that ends with .1e12d831
(1:21:03 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: am i nee dto append this sting to file name?
(1:21:41 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: no...
(1:21:42 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hang on
(1:23:07 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: actually
(1:23:09 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: just skip that step
(1:23:33 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ?
(1:23:45 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: because in our other hosts, none of it has that symbolic link
(1:23:54 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and it's doing GSI auth without problems
(1:23:59 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: ok
(1:24:11 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and my SRB server (which is working now!  yaya!!) also does not have those links
(1:24:15 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(1:24:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I guess it's one of the fun thigns with ARCS
(1:24:30 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: the documentation never seems to quite fit the actual reality
(1:35:10 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: If I follow the procedure my directory structure look like this
(1:35:12 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: [root@vmcentsrb grid-security]# pwd
/etc/grid-security/certificates/grid-security
[root@vmcentsrb grid-security]# ls
certificates  globus-host-ssl.conf  globus-user-ssl.conf  grid-security.conf
[root@vmcentsrb grid-security]#
(1:35:51 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Its not promissing
(1:36:10 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(1:36:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I really don't know...
(1:36:36 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: can you try connecting to it using just Sinit from windows>?
(1:36:49 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: hangon
(1:39:50 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: No luck..
(1:39:52 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: C:\>Sinit

(1:41:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(1:41:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: this is weird
(1:41:30 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: can you do a Sinit -v?
(1:42:17 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes..
(1:42:18 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home:

(1:42:36 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: huh?!?!?!
(1:42:44 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: what?
(1:42:44 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that's really odd...
(1:42:46 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it
(1:42:51 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's the correct version of client...
(1:44:04 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am getting sick of this..
(1:44:13 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah... I was a bit like that
(1:44:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: just post a question to basecamp
(1:44:22 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hopefully someone can answer your question
(1:44:26 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ok lets hope GSI is working and everything fine..
(1:44:31 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I might have added confusion to this though...
(1:44:53 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ah
(1:45:00 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: did you try this on your server?
(1:45:05 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au:  How to check that your new APAC Grid Host Certificate works.

    * ssh/putty into your command line log in account.
    * openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates /etc/gridsecurity/hostcert.pem
    * It should respond with:
          o /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem: OK 
    * If it does not respond as above, your /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem either
          o does not exist.
          o has the wrong permissions.
          o the certificate is not correct.
          o has the wrong ownership.
          o does not match the any Certificate Authority bundle on your server. 

(1:45:25 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Not really, I like you patience
(1:47:25 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: hang on
(1:47:44 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(1:50:52 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I am getting error..
(1:50:54 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: [root@vmcentsrb grid-security]#  openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ /home/hostcert/hostcert.pem

(1:51:16 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: oh...
(1:51:24 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: let me try on mine
(1:52:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: [root@srb ~]# cd /etc/grid-security/
[root@srb grid-security]# openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem 
/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem: OK
[root@srb grid-security]# 

(1:52:21 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ah
(1:52:25 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: /home/hostcert/hostcert.pem
(1:52:36 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: change that to where your host certificate is
(1:52:40 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: is that in /var/lib/srb?
(1:52:45 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Actually I copied my host cert/keys at /home/hostcertificate insted of /etc/grid-security as yours
(1:52:50 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: oh
(1:56:02 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have changed /usr/srb/bin/runsrb to point to my certificate location
(1:56:04 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: X509_USER_KEY=/home/hostcert/hostkey.pem
X509_USER_CERT=/home/hostcert/hostcert.pem
(1:56:12 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(1:56:14 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yes
(1:56:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that is important
(1:56:36 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: maybe try restarting the server and see if you can Sinit?
(1:56:41 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: (srb server)
(1:58:20 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: No change.. I leave this until Youzhen come back and will discuss with him
(1:58:24 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah...
(1:58:26 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: sorry :/
(1:58:30 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: For what?
(1:58:37 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: not being able to solve the problem
(1:58:56 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Thats alright alleast we tried..
(1:59:39 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: with your help.. with out your help it will be more worse
(2:00:14 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ok now if GSI auth starts working then what we can do ? I mean what I need to learn next?
(2:02:20 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: setting up resources...
(2:02:26 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: just try transferring files around
(2:02:28 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: oh
(2:02:34 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: and federate with other dev servers
(2:03:25 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: for federating I cant do anything from my testing vm running on my desktop as firewall issues..
(2:03:33 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: oh
(2:03:35 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: bummer!~
(2:03:57 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have already played with setting resources, adding users, moving files from client to server etc..
(2:04:35 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: though everything with username/password authentication
(2:05:03 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(2:05:06 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(2:05:08 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I'm not sure
(2:05:12 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: perhaps you should ask Florian?
(2:05:19 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: did he ask you to do anything else?
(2:05:52 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Nope he asked me install srb and play with it. Thats what I did for almost 2 weeks
(2:05:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ahh
(2:05:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok
(2:06:43 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I guess you should able to access srb.ac3.edu.au from your place
(2:06:58 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that
(2:07:00 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: woops
(2:07:04 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that's your production server right?
(2:07:08 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes..
(2:07:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I don't think it's federated
(2:07:41 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: We will try federating that soon, once I get access to it.
(2:08:04 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: ok :)
(2:08:15 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: Shunde wrote a really cool script that will make it really easy
(2:08:17 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: actually
(2:08:32 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: have you got access to subversion?
(2:08:39 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: what is that?
(2:08:47 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: http://projects.arcs.org.au/trac/systems/browser/trunk/data-services
(2:08:55 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: subversion is a type of version controlling system
(2:09:00 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: all our sources go into it
(2:09:09 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: that directory I've given you contains a list of xml files
(2:09:15 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Yes I am able to see xml files over there..
(2:09:24 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: each specifying properties of all our production servers there
(2:09:31 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Ohhh
(2:09:34 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: so tpac has one... sapac has one, etc
(2:09:40 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Am I need to learn xml?
(2:09:43 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I think ac3 should have one too
(2:09:47 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: hmm
(2:10:01 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: I suppose...
(2:10:18 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: but it's not complicated, and we don't even have a schema to validate with
(2:10:24 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: it's just a plain text file with lots of <> tags
(2:10:49 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I know bit html, so I may learn it quickly..
(2:10:53 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: if you look at the example files, you should be able to generate your own
(2:11:07 PM) pauline.mak@arcs.org.au: yeah, with your html skills, it should be pretty easy to adapt
