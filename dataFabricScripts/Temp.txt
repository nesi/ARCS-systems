(3:28:43 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Hi florian
(3:29:24 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: Hello
(3:29:42 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I have run few tests on my dev srb server and srb.ac3.edu.au
(3:30:10 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: and found reason for slowness is poor performance of srb.ac3.edu.au
(3:30:16 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: not ANSTO's data
(3:30:34 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: that was my suspicion 
(3:30:49 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: did you find a spcific bottlneck?
(3:31:03 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: I had chat with youzhen about disks performance
(3:31:37 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: yes, while running any Scommands on srb.ac3.edu.au 90+% cpu is waiting for IO
(3:33:13 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: disks mounted for srb resources are from nfs, I am guessing this might be one reason for performance degrade
(3:33:20 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: it is
(3:33:30 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: i had the same problem last week with srb.ivec.org
(3:33:41 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: but luckily there is a fix for that
(3:33:53 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: and vm itself is on machine with only 2Gb ram sharing with other 2-3 vms
(3:34:00 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: wow
(3:34:18 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: my desktop has more than that :)
(3:35:02 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: same with mine as well I built my dev srb server on my desktop(3gb ram) which is running like horse
(3:35:16 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: :)
(3:35:48 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: to fix the NFS bottleneck, you have to install a MCATless SRB server on the box that actually has the disks
(3:36:14 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: you then can use the SRB protocol to talk to the disks
(3:36:20 PM) sridhar.reddapani@arcs.org.au/Home: Is there any procedure on web for that?
(3:36:20 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: much faster then NFS
(3:36:29 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: there are no instructions yet
(3:36:32 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: but it is easy
(3:36:40 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: Steve and I both run setups like this
(3:37:05 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: these are the steps (as Steve told me):



(3:37:07 PM) florian.goessmann@arcs.org.au: 


1. Install a non MCAT SRB server on the host with the data
e.g. cd to SRB source dir
./configure --enable-installdir=/opt/srb/3.5.0 --enable-gsi-auth --enable-globus-location=/opt/globus/4.0.7
make
make install
I'm not sure that GSI was needed but I did it anyway



2.
edit srb install dir/data/mcatHost and set the address of the MCAT enabled host

make sure that there's an srb user. Copy the .srb directory from the main server. Edit .MdasEnv file and set the srbHost to the current (new) host.

start the new server with runsrb or an init script as you do the main server
that sets up the server


then to create resources on the new server you must first create a new location - like you do for federation
could use Sregisterlocation or the mcatAdmin.jar file

then create the resource as you do before but use the new location. As you would know the resource points to a directory which is read and writable by the local srb user
